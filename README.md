# samuraiwtf ultralight edition

## What is this? And how does it relate to the main SamuraiWTF build?
This is my personal experimental fork. It exists for the pursuit of ideas that aren't necessarily compatible with the upstream at this time. If you're actually teaching a class, I recommend using the upstream version instead.

**To download an OVA to import a full virtual machine, visit https://tiny.si/samurai. 

A [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a3qOFubfGg) is available showing how to install from OVA.

## Prerequisites
- Vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/
- Virtualization Software - The base vagrant box used supports virtualbox, vmware, and parallels, but testing at this time has been solely on virtualbox - https://www.virtualbox.org/
- vagrant-vbguest plugin for vagrant (virtualbox only) - this automatically installs guest extensions which provide support for higher display resolutions, as well as other conveniences like clipboard sharing - https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest
- Disable Hyper-V (Windows and Virtualbox only) - follow the Resolution instructions provided by Microsoft to disable and enable Hyper-V (requires reboot) - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3204980/virtualization-applications-do-not-work-together-with-hyper-v-device-g

## Initial Install
1. Make sure you have the prereqs listed above. Webpwnized has made some helpful [YouTube video instructionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCqpTpxNSlA&list=PLZOToVAK85Mru8ye3up3VR_jXms56OFE5) for getting Vagrant and VirtualBox  with vbguest plugin installed in case you have not done so before.
2. Clone this repository.
3. From a command-line terminal in the project directory, run the command `vagrant up`. Then sit back and wait for it to finish. NOTE: The Guest VM's window will open with the CLI while provisioning is still ongoing. It's best to leave it alone until the vagrant up command fully completes.
4. Immediately after the first time start up it is recommend you do a restart using vagrant reload.

## Running Separate User / Target Systems
- Just running the `vagrant up` will build the primary target, which is a single VM with both the user environment and the targets.  
- You can run `vagrant up userenv` and `vagrant up target` to build seperate virtual machines for those purposes.)

**NOTE: The Guest VM's window will open with the CLI while provisioning is still ongoing. It's best to leave it alone until the `vagrant up` command fully completes.**

### Provisioning Scripts
The main Vagrant provisioning script for SamuraiWTF is *install/userenv_bootstrap.sh*.  A standalone targets provisioning script is in *install/target_bootstrap.sh*.  Changes for the system, targets, or tools installation or initialization for SamuraiWTF are all handled within these scripts.

## Production VM Notes:
Once you load the VM, the username and password are:

- Username: samurai
- Password: samurai

The menus are available via a right click on the desktop.

Once you log in the target systems need to be provisioned. (Working on doing this during the build!)

First, load the Chrome bookmarks by starting *Chrome*.  Then select the *three dots* menu and select *Bookmarks*.
From the sub menu, select *Import bookmarks and settings*.  In the window that opens, select *Bookmarks HTML File*.
A file selector window will open.  Select the *chrome_bookmarks.html* file in the samurai home directory.

Some of the target environments need to be initialized before use.  Use their setup or Reset DB links to do this.

## Virtualbox Display
- To automatically adjust the display resolution, do the following:
	- Select Virtualbox Menu -> View
	- Click Auto-Resize Guest Display
	- Resize Virtualbox window and display should change to fit window size.
